	<p>This is On My Honor, a mini-series consisting of interviews and research done in 2017 that takes a hard look into the history of academic and personal integrity at UVA. The Honor Code is a pledge by which which all students swear on our honor, not to lie, cheat, or steal while at the University. This code has been part of the University for nearly all of its 200-year history.  These interviews will reveal that UVA’s perception of honor may be an illusion – that maybe we’re not living in the honorary academic sphere we think we are. </p>

	<p>The Bliss Chamber is a narrative/sonic experiment, inviting you to imagine an environment in which your problems have gone away, simply in virtue of your willful ignorance. To hear and to experience this environment is my goal in this project, as well as to suggest why this approach is no longer sustainable. Music by Jean Glas. </p>
